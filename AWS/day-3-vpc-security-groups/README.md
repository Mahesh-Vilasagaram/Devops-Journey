# AWS Day 3 – VPC & Security Groups

## Key Concepts
- VPC is an isolated virtual network in AWS
- Public subnets have internet access
- Private subnets do not have direct internet access

## Security Groups

- Control inbound and outbound traffic
- Are stateful

## Hands-on
- Modified security group rules
- Allowed SSH and HTTP access
- Verified traffic flow to EC2

## Interview Notes
