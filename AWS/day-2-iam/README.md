# AWS Day 2 – IAM Security

## IAM Concepts
- IAM User: Human or application accessing AWS
- IAM Policy: Defines permissions
- IAM Role: Secure way for AWS services to access other services

## Hands-on Performed
- Created IAM user with limited EC2 access
- Created IAM role for EC2 to access S3
- Attached role to EC2 instance

## Interview Notes
- Never use root user for daily tasks
- IAM roles are more secure than access keys
- Principle of least privilege is critical
